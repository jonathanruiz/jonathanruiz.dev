        <h2>Design Principles</h2>

        <h3>Proximity &mdash; Brandon Layton</h3>
        <img
          src="img/proximity.png"
          alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use"
        />
        <p>
          The use of proximity in the site allows for the user to easily
          understand the different parts of the website. The website effectively
          groups similar elements together in an easy to understand way. It is
          not hard to distinguish a different part of the web page from another
          part. The section that contains the colors is noticeably a different
          section then the social media links even though they are only
          separated by whitespace.
        </p>

        <h3>Alignment &mdash; Justin Wilson</h3>
        <img
          src="img/alignment.png"
          alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use"
        />
        <p>
          Alignment is well used on the homepage of our chosen website. As can
          be seen in the screenshot, the color sample elements are aligned
          vertically and horizontally. Additionally, each of these items are
          identical in size which makes the alignment look very neat and
          uniform. The text in the header is also aligned with the text in the
          body of the page, and the body headers are all centered creating a
          neat appearance throughout.
        </p>

        <h3>Repetition &mdash; Jonathan Ruiz</h3>
        <img
          src="img/repetition.png"
          alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use"
        />
        <p>
          The use of repetition in this site allows the user to recognize the
          different choices of color within the site. It shows a consistent
          square filled with the assigned color and the user to can browse
          through and choose among the recommended colors. By default and
          without really giving much thought, the user will know that a small
          square will designate another color.
        </p>

        <h3>Contrast &mdash; Matt Hare</h3>
        <img
          src="img/contrast.png"
          alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use"
        />
        <p>
          This website uses contrast by using a white background with black
          text. This provides a healthy contrast so that makes it easy to read.
          Additionally, the header is a lighter grey to signify that is a drop
          down header. Another thing that the site did well is that it clearly
          shows what the links on the page are in blue.
        </p>

        <h3>Typography &mdash; Justin Wilson</h3>
        <img
          src="img/typography.png"
          alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use"
        />
        <p>
          This site uses four different font styles: one for the site header,
          one for the body, one for the h1 headers and one for the color hex
          codes. While four font styles is over the recommended number (3), this
          is justifiable because the Courier font used for the hex values is
          understood by developers to represent code, and as such this
          additional font would make sense to the target audience.
        </p>

        <h2>Site Purpose Statement</h2>
        <p>
          It will help web designers create color palettes with different color
          models such as RGB and Hexcode. It also shows CSS examples that are
          easy to implement into your own CSS code.
