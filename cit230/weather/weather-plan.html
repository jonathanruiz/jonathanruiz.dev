        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of <strong><em>The Weather Site</em></strong> is to give
          current weather conditions in 3 different ways. The initial page will
          give the weather for the current location based on the Geocoding
          location information from the device. The second is weather for 3
          specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the third
          is weather for any location determined by a search string.
        </p>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
          Primary audience is adults ages 18-30. Most will be students. Access
          to the site will be split between mobile devices and laptops. A
          secondary audience will be anyone interested in weather.

        <h2>Audience Goals</h2>
        <p>
          College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to
          quickly get the weather conditions for their current location as they
          head off to class or study. They are also often far from their homes
          so the ability to quickly get the conditions for a specific location
          is important as well. The third goal deals with planning for
          travels...the ability to get weather conditions for any location will
          help with last minute packing for road trips.

        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <img src="./images/cool-joe.jpg" alt="snoopy" />
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Name:</strong> Joe Cool</li>
          <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> student</li>
          <li><strong>Age:</strong> Eternally 18</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interests:</strong> Traveling, Flying, Play acting, Eating
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Motivation:</strong> Joe is not into planning. His last
            minute scrambling, whether it is getting to class in the morning or
            heading out on his latest adventure, has left him unprepared for
            weather conditions many times (He is tired of sleeping in the rain
            and snow). He would like to be more prepared...without having to put
            much effort into it...or planning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Environment:</strong> Joe is comfortable using laptops and
            Mobile devices, he will most often be found on a smart phone
            however. Many of the places he frequents do not have great signal…he
            is often dealing with 3G speeds
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
          All weather pages should include location name, current temperature,
          forecast high, forecast low, current weather descriptor, forecast
          percentage of precipitation, and current wind speed and direction on
          small devices and hourly temps should be added on larger screens. The
          pages of the <strong><em>Weather Site</em></strong
          >will be built in the following order:
        </p>
        <h3>Pages</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Franklin and Greenville:</strong> weather for each specific
            location. The weather for these pages should be pulled from the
            weather.JSON file that will be provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Current:</strong> weather for the current location. Current
            location should be determined by using the Geolocation API of the
            browser. This information should be passed to the National Weather
            Service (NWS) API to retrieve the current conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Search:</strong> Begins with only a search box, characters
            entered will cause a list of suggested matches to appear. Selected
            location will pull up the weather.
          </li>
        </ol>
